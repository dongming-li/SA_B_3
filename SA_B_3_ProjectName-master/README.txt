Project Name: Raise Hand

Overview of project:
This project will allow students to ask questions anonymously by submitting them
in the app. Other students within the class can see these questions 
(to avoid duplication as well as to answer them). The teacher would be able to 
endorse those answers. When the class is in session, the questions will appear
in the news feed in the event that a student is scared to ‘raise their hand’, 
otherwise there will be something similar to a discussion board. There will  
be a web portal for the teacher as well. There will also be a profile for the 
teaching assistants to access the questions and answer and endorse answers. 
There will also be a web interface to be able to watch the feed and go through
the discussion board. All this information will be kept in databases for each 
class and the applications will fetch the data as requested by the user.
There will be student security, users, teachers, and teaching assistants. 
Students can download the application and create an account, and then add the 
class with a code the teacher gives them. Students in a class are able to submit
questions to the teachers and other students. The students are also able to 
answer other students questions. The questions can be anonymous where only the 
teacher can see the student's name, or they can publicly show their name to 
other students. There will be a system to make sure that the more correct 
answers appear toward the top of the discussion board.
